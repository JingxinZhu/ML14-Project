.@IvanWaldorf So fun! Really exciting. It was my first time.  @TheAcademy

.@Flinkaroo Heinz
@PerezHilton I tried to call him 'sir' - he asked me to call him Tony. What a man. I have so much respect for him. He was truly humble.
.@Orderofpotter EMPATHY. To be a great actor I think you need to be a great listener. You've got to care about people.

No doubt, there are reasons for your worries, no one could dispute, but that doesn't make them any less useless. It's ok to let them go. ;^)

U can lose your limbs and still be whole but if u think you're different than a Russian or better than an Arab u truly are an amputee. ;^}
You can be American, Canadian, Isreali, or Iranian but no man can put a border around who you really are. #BOING has no boundries! ;^D
Never let your mind and your ego fill you with the fear of failure and turn you against your playful heart. Always follow your #BOING ;^D
My birthday is Jan 17th. You all have me confused with some other transient manifestation. But #spankyoukindly, anyway. ;^)

#BOING is the all pervasive unending unfathomable absolute,the unified field of energy that gives rise to all relative forms.Wholeness! ;^D
Heaven is always ready and waiting for you, wherever you are. Embrace your #BOING ;^)
Aliveness itself is eating, drinking, breathing, thinking, and feeling through something known as Jim Carrey. It's fun for me to watch.  ;^)
I am free from concern at this moment. No fear. No yearning. No I. Just a relative expressions of the unifed field. Infinite #BOING  ;^}

I may be off the air on TV this week, but check out my work on the CB radio band as "Gingey, the Truckstop Whore."
Just benched 300 (sat on a bench, watched "300"). 
Saturn just gave birth to a moon. I'm pretty sure she¹s not a single parent, because she has a ring.
Let¹s face it, anyone named Captain America should be overweight and have a porn addiction.
Camped out at CVS so I can beat the rush for half-priced Peeps.

Who painted these Easter eggs? BANKSY!!!
Babies are being named after "Game of Thrones" characters?  What parents would name a baby after a sword wielding, mythological character?

Do you think Putin just misunderstood the term “March Madness”?
An artist puking on @LadyGaga is national news, but no one cares that I drooled on @SofiaVergara?

Just took one of those “Which Movie Character Are You?” quizzes and found out I’m the plastic bag from American Beauty.
How much does Ira Glass charge to narrate a sex tape?
A new study shows on average, men’s brains are larger than women’s. But the extra space is filled entirely with barbecue sauce.
Watching that new Irish hoarding show, where they clean out a man’s lifetime accumulation of slights, rebuffs and resentments.

I love to go up to Spanish people and say, “any FLANS for the weekend?” They love that.
 Still holding out hope that "Blending In With a White Wall" will become an Olympic event.

Nicole will always be a part of the X factor family. Now signed to Sony as an artist. Thank you Nicole for everything.
And I hope to share some very very exciting news with you next week.
And of course good luck to my lil buddy Demi. A big supporter of acts on the show.
Wishing little mix and fifth harmony good luck tonight in la. On tour with my buddy Demi.
The Alex and Sierra early tracks are fantastic. I have huge faith in these two.
And to anyone considering applying for X factor this year. Do it. We are taking this year very seriously. It's all about the talent
We saw some brilliant acts today at the London britains got talent auditions. Very happy.
And I have to thank the incredible fans reactions. Appreciate every message.
Thought I should try and explain what really happened. Both fox and us made the decision to protect a very important brand to us.
Sometimes we rest these shows in other countries. And that's what we did in a crowded market. In most cases the show returned stronger.
The last time I appeared on X factor uk it resulted in over 45 million record sales. So I decided last year to return home to the uk show.
Not quite sure who "offered" X factor USA to a rival network. It wasn't my company. There will always be speculation about these things.
Hi. Am with @Stephenmulhern at britains got talent.Has no followers on twitter. Can you help?
We found some amazing talent. And now the search begins to find the next star. That's why we make these shows.
I have had a blast. Really the best time of my life. Thank you for the support and the fun we have had together. It's never forgotten.
You realise how much you owe to the fans who have supported all of the shows we made in both countries.
Today was a day of mixed emotions. Excited to confirm me returning to the Uk X factor and sad to leave America.
Some of my friends went to see the new Lego movie last night. All saying its genius.
I just got back from bit auditions in Birmingham. Really good and really strange. Lowlight was a dancing owl. Who didn't.
I have just been told that the new little mix album is number one on the us iTunes album chart. That is bloody fantastic. Congratulations
Loved X Factor Italia. Now you'll be able to watch Got Talent on Sky. Have fun Italy!
My friend Katie Piper has a new show on tonight. It's on channel 4 at ten pm. I heard it's really good.
I was thinking on the flight how many great records there were last year. The music business feels exciting again. No rules.

The most dreadful word you can hear when someone is praising you is "but"
Escrever "Adultério" foi como cruzar o oceano sozinho em um veleiro. Muito excitante, mas muito arriscado

HHDL speaks about genuine friendship in this short video clip from his meeting with students in New Delhi on March 22 http://t.co/OLWVy88FG5
When you are concerned for the welfare of others, bullying and exploitation cease.
Live Webcast: HHDL will bestow the Medicine Buddha Empowerment from Dharamsala, India on March 31st. http://t.co/sAB4Rrd3VE
We have to try to solve local problems keeping global interests in mind.
We can teach people how to be happy on the basis of secular ethics, that a compassionate mind is useful, beneficial and secular in nature.
The power of truth never declines. Force and violence may be effective in the short term, but in the long run it’s truth that prevails.
Concern for others is not just a matter of religious practice; it’s a practical step towards creating a happy society.
Live Webcast: HHDL’s teaching on the “Life Stories of the Buddha (Jataka Tales)” from Dharamsala, India on March 16. http://t.co/sAB4Rrd3VE
Even people opposed to religion need calm minds and compassion to make their work more effective.
Watch: HHDL delivers the Opening Prayer at the US Senate on Capitol Hill in Washington DC on March 6th. http://t.co/bjNtNMyFAS
We all need basic human values rooted in trust and affection.

Live: Panel discussions with HHDL hosted by the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, DC on February 20th. http://t.co/sAB4RqUUHw
Everyone wants to lead a happy life, a meaningful life. In order to fulfil this goal our practice should be realistic.
When you face problems in your lives, don’t resort to the use of force, try to employ dialogue to find a solution.
Whether we follow a religious path or not, as human beings we all need affection.
We must design education that provides for both knowledge and a healthy mind, creating a sense of compassion that responds to all humanity.
We have to build a better, more equal world through peace and non-violence.
It would help if there were greater understanding that anger never helps to solve a problem.
Leading your life honestly and truthfully will create trust and friendship.
Now we’re so interdependent, we need to build trust and confidence. On a national or personal level self-centredness is a source of trouble.
You can’t help someone just by making a wish to do so, you have to take action.
We need a sense of belonging to one humanity, respecting the rights and views of others.
If you dedicate yourself to helping others, you’ll be happier.
We can only transform humanity and create a happier more compassionate world through education.
HHDL’s New Year’s message in this short video clip from his teachings at Sera Jey Monastery, South India on Jan 1st. http://t.co/PqW9SoOBYp
Today, let us wish each other a Happy New Year, but also that we may make it meaningful.
No matter what our motivation may be, if we are not realistic we will not fulfil our goal.
In order to exercise creativity, freedom of thought is essential.

Sometimes things go wrong; that’s normal. But we have a saying in Tibetan, ‘Nine times fail, nine times try again'.
Because of the risks involved in indulging in unrestrained desire and greed we need to cultivate contentment and simplicity.
I believe compassion to be one of the few things we can practice that will bring immediate and long-term happiness to our lives.
HHDL is greeted by students on his arrival at Yakumo Academy, a girl’s school in Tokyo, Japan on November 18th http://t.co/HNIlDS8ICk
Not only is your own happiness and welfare related to others, but the more you help them, the happier you will be.
I try to treat whoever I meet as an old friend. This gives me a genuine feeling of happiness.
Live Webcast: HHDL's one day teaching on "Three Principal Aspects of the Path" in Dharamsala, India on November 11. http://t.co/sAB4RqUUHw
Since we are increasingly interdependent it's time to develop a sense of global responsibility, to help each other and promote human values.
Great changes start with individuals; the basis of world peace is inner peace in the hearts of individuals, something we can all work for.
If we have a good heart and concern for others, our actions will be positive.
The challenge today is to convince people of the value of truth, honesty, compassion and a concern for others.
Live: Mind &amp; Life XXVII Conference - Desire, Craving and Addiction with HHDL from Dharamsala, India on Oct 28 - Nov 1 http://t.co/jlX58DOpMq

As human beings, we have a common responsibility to build a more peaceful society.
The opponent of peace of mind is not something external, but within us.
Use your human intelligence in the best way you can; transform your emotions in a positive way.
Fear that makes us run from a mad dog is useful and necessary, whereas fear rooted in mistrust is unhelpful and needs to be overcome.

Forgiveness is how we put a stop to anger, ill-will and a desire for revenge.
Live Webcast: HHDL's talk "The Culture of Compassion" from Riga, Latvia on September 9th starting at 1:30pm CEST http://t.co/5c2MkGO3ef
If we have peace of mind, we’ll always feel happy. Deceiving ourselves that money is the source of happiness, we won’t.
I’m optimistic that there is a growing appetite for peace in the world. Many young people are fed up with war and violence.

Live: HHDL's teaching on Stages of the Path to Enlightenment &amp; Overview of Tantra from Dharamsala, India August 25-27 http://t.co/sAB4RqUUHw
Blessings don’t come from outside, but from within. Whatever blessings we receive are the result of our own efforts and positive actions.
Anger destroys our peace of mind and causes trouble. It also hampers our ability to function properly.
Wherever I go I talk to people about the need to be aware of the oneness of humanity.
Compassion is what makes our lives meaningful.
Instead of harboring fear and suspicion we need to think of other people not as ‘them’ but ‘us’.
It is important to let people know that they have the source of contentment and happiness within themselves.
Live Webcast: HHDL and Rev. Dada J.P. Vaswani, hosted by Aamir Khan from Pune, India on July 28th. http://t.co/9oMNywJEMH
Peace can only be achieved through non-violence. This is something we have to train and educate our children to put into effect.
Video in support of Mandela Day (appearance by HHDL). Join in helping to perpetuate Nelson Mandela's legacy. http://t.co/MHBzbtTPgc
A person who practices compassion and forgiveness has great inner strength, whereas aggression is usually a sign of weakness.
Among human beings trust comes about, not from expressions of wealth or fame, but from our showing affection.
When you concern yourself with others, you naturally develop a sense of self-confidence. To help others takes courage and inner strength.

Despite the superficial differences between us, we need to have a sense that all 7 billion human beings belong to one human family.
What we do need to do is to find ways to incorporate advice about warm-heartedness into our education system.

أخطأ من ظن أن الموت فناء لا حياة بعده ولاحساب،
لو كان كذلك: لانتفت الحكمة من الخلق والوجود،
ولاستوى القاتل والمقتول، والظالم والمظلوم ..!
وكان سيدي رسول الله
من أحلم الناس، وأقلهم غضباً وأشدّ حياء من العذراء في خِدرها،
إذا كره شيئًا عُرِف ذلك في وجهه، وكان أشدّ الناس تَواضُعًا

Thanks for talking. Watch the @MaronIFC premiere tonight. It's hilarious. Features @nerdist @michaelianblack &amp; @sarahksilverman 10/9c @IFC
@mattybyloos At The Comedy Store last Friday.
@DomGurr It plays a role with some comedians. And I wouldn't call it a card, because that implies it's a game. And it's very serious.
@bright_world_of Maybe something really weird will happen to everybody at the same time and bring us closer together.
@jamescomins @marcmaron Keep him busy and give him ice cream occasionally.
@noSHANEnoGAIN @marcmaron "A Serious Man"
@Wilphred @marcmaron I'm not sure that would be a great omen for your marriage.
@MrNix26 I haven't been asked to do it, so...no?
@DaringDareBear I'll check my calendar...sorry, can't do it.
@MrNix26 I'm proud of all of them. The one I directed called "The Joke" I'm very excited about. It features @madflavor.
@MattyWiesMang @marcmaron Sure, I love being used to help someone else's problems.
@joeoneleg Curly. Of course, stupid.
@totobernal @marcmaron Listening.
@DoctorJiggaWho No. I have to dig up the whole driveway.
@nick0martin @ThisAmerLife @marcmaron Yes. I don't always respond though.
@Wilphred @marcmaron Up until this one, yeah.
@hrosencrants @marcmaron White Riot.
@aidan_connell5 Somewhere under water.
@mvinegrad I don't want to live in the world where those are the only two options.
@UTHero I guess it would be destroy my second marriage.
@RefriedJeans @louisck I'd love to work with @louisck but I don't want to be an opener.
@fieldsofjuniper @MaronIFC Probably the Gallagher episode.
@AnEclecticTaste I don't hate Scotland. I just had a food meltdown there. And Edinburgh was difficult for me.
@juankitney @marcmaron Yes and I've got about almost 2,000 vinyls probably.
@karimsabet @marcmaron Did I?
@andrewin3d @marcmaron I don't like the feeling of having something in my eye.
@toneshifter @marcmaron It was just too difficult emotionally at this time.
@Wilphred @marcmaron Absolutely not. I get overwhelmed and edgy sometimes, but no diva.
@DustDevil75 The @MarkMulcahyHQ album "Dear Mark J. Mulcahy, I Love You"
@SubySalt I had a cat that did that, but not anymore. #boomerlives
@AidanDoheny I'm kind of partial to "Nighthawks at the Diner" and "Heart Attack and Vine"
@r_katers I would say just be accepting and don't be pushy or nosey.
@DianaDee16 @marcmaron Spicy food?
@ashman0311 Awww, thanks.
@burgled_turds @marcmaron No. I will now.
@gofeltyourself A hybrid of Cookie Monster, Oscar The Grouch and Kermit.
@Tomcat1108 Acting with other people.
@TheAwesomeator Richard Pryor, Woody Allen, Sam Kinison, Buddy Hackett and Shelley Berman
@NrdCftLibrarian @IFC @marcmaron Absolutely. Because I can tweak them, so I have more control than I did in the real events.
@RefriedJeans They're very different. I obviously have a lot more freedom, absolute freedom, on the podcast.
@penaazlall I sacrificed any other possibility to do it. So, difficult.
@ponybon @marcmaron Ben &amp; Jerry's Peanut Butter Cup and vanilla
@peterbeckdk @louisck We're good. I did a scene in the new season of Louie.
@Andrew_Reaume @marcmaron Almost all my bits are like that.
@RussBGrant @marcmaron @daveanthony I guess I'd marry Dave, I would kill Gallagher and I would fuck Carrot Top...with an agenda.
@NotYourShow @marcmaron Always emotional.
@AndrewPoulsen @marcmaron I'd really like to talk to Bob Newhart.
@rylanleese @marcmaron A little, because I don't want to completely alienate possible guests.
@val_kitten @marcmaron I prefer the word "complex" and I can only speak for me.
@manixdetroit @marcmaron Too needy.
@JohnAtlanta @marcmaron Some days I think that, some days not so much.
@nolacyn @marcmaron Whatever they gotta do to feel whole.
@miraclefalls @marcmaron Probably Wayne Kramer of MC5.
@AlexPowers_ @marcmaron I don't think there was a bridge to be burned and I think he has no desire to do my podcast.
@ThatKidTapia01 A new joke.
@Webpuppy45 @marcmaron Me too.
@jrswam @marcmaron Yes on Ty. In contact with Berman.
@PorchAuthority @marcmaron I don't know if there's one, but I'd be lost without AC/DC's  "Powerage"
@SCruzBeats @marcmaron I enjoy Kumail more than his comedy.
@chitownben @marcmaron @adamcarolla Patent trolls could crush all of us.
@tessycrystal1 @marcmaron Cuz noses be funny sometime
@Bwana86 @marcmaron @jayduplass @JoelMurray9of9 When I get around to it.
@ArchdukeJFranz @marcmaron Led Zeppelin's "Physical Graffiti" but that may change tomorrow.
@rp_boyle @marcmaron That's what Lou told me to do.
@rp_boyle @marcmaron I use a medium. Gotta use a medium.
@MillerBlain @marcmaron Why are you so judgmental of what blind people can and can't do?
@SportsGeyser @marcmaron Nothing embarrassing, just a lip.
@Vonhuss Either way it would be very uncomfortable.
@RealLifeHoser @marcmaron ...The best work out room is The Comedy Store.
@RealLifeHoser @marcmaron ......Favorite show is the taping of the Thinky Pain special. Or the half hour I did in 1995 at the Fillmore...
@RealLifeHoser @marcmaron My favorite club to perform in is Acme in Minneapolis &amp; the Punchline in San Francisco...
@stevebraband @marcmaron Albert Brooks, Tom Waits, Bob Newhart, Lily Tomlin

@agh___ that's what I love about One Piece. In fact the whole strawhat crew don't give a fuck about anything, except friendship &amp; treasure.
@MVerbond i disagree. Their goals are not the same at all. But nevertheless, yay gintama!
Piala it is “@erick_firman: @zimamulumam I dn't see it that way. The reason why he wants to be hokage is merely to be acknowledged by every1
Still, Luffy wants ultimate freedom, and so do I. Ah ciee Oda ngerti gue banget deh.
@zimamulumam at the start of the series he was so sick of failing, he aspired to be the strongest ninja in the village. (Hokage)
@zimamulumam pretty sure naruto's first intention wasn't peace for the village. Maybe now with the war going on, yes, he wants peace.
@IndraAziz awesome! Mampir kesini yuk!
But from Naruto's POV, after years of being ridiculed by almost every1, it's understandable if at some point you'd want to prove them wrong.
It's my personal subjective opinion, but I'd rather obtain my goals the Luffy way. Go D!
Comparing goals. Obtain One Piece = pirate king = ultimate freedom. Obtain Hokage title = strongest ninja = ultimate respect from others?
Saya pilih Luffy yg menjadikan 'prestasi' sebagai bagian dari petualangnnya. Bukan keinginan untuk membuktikan diri pada rekan2nya.
Menunjukan prestasi mdh2an dgn niat utk menularkan inspirasi, bukan haus tepuk tangan. Gak sindir siapa siapa ya. Ini ngomongin Naruto.

Texans could have a MONSTER front 4 on defense. Just took DT Louis Nix III out of Notre Dame. He'll join Clowney and J.J. Watt. #HOUpick
DEVELOPING: Yu Darvish is completely DOMINATING the Boston Red Sox through 6 IP. http://t.co/aY1VLHH9xQ
He broke Bo Jackson's Auburn rushing records. Tre Mason goes 75th overall to the St. Louis Rams. #STLpick http://t.co/BxsxEJjjAN
The Pacers have blown it WIDE open in the 3rd quarter. Indiana leads, 60-45 after 3, have held the Wizards under 20 points all 3 quarters.
Rangers force Game 6! Derick Brassard scores twice and assists on a third to spur the Rangers to a 5-1 thumping of the Penguins in Game 5.
The Patriots have selected Jimmy Garoppolo, QB out of Eastern Illinois, with the 62nd pick in the draft. QB of the future? #NEpick
